#Shazam

Shazam is a clone of the music recognition software built in ECE 2200: Signal Processing as a final project written in Matlab. It uses peak analysis in the frequency domain to match segments of songs to the song id.

The software is robust enough to deal with white noise without even a Gaussian or Butterworth Filter, but those are implemented as well. It also supports realtime sound recording recognition in addition to database song recognition.
