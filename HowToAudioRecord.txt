Hello, class. The following functions might be handy when recording the clip for the real-time test in the part B.
Best luck! 

Useful funcitons:

1. recorder = audiorecorder(Fs,bitsPerSample,channel);% Declare recorder variable with some defined properties
2. recordblocking(recorder,recordTime);% Record audio for the amount of "recordTime"
3. y = getaudiodata(recorder);% Getting the audio date recorded by the variable "recorder"
